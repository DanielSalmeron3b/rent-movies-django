# Rent Movies with Django

## Usage
- Download the code and activate a virtual environment
- Make database migrations: python manage.py makemigrations
- python manage.py migrate
- After a successful migration run the application: python manage.py runserver
- For the Admin Panel credentials, you have to create one with a **superuser**.

## REST API
For the REST API you can use the Thunder Client VS Extension or other programm like Postman or Insomnia.

## Database
I left some commented in settings.py code if you want to use **MySQL.**
